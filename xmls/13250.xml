      <Description>Oldunreal's 227 Patch
https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/oldunreal-patches/

This patch was made to offer all Unreal players a new, completely overworked and fixed version for our old "love". Although the main target was bugfixing, many improvements have been made and a lot of additions found their way into this new version. The general gameplay and the game itself was not touched and it should remain 100% compatible to old mods and maps.</Description>
